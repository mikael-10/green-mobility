# Green Mobility and CO₂ Impact in Italy

This project explores the environmental impact of road transportation in Italy, focusing on sustainable mobility trends such as electric vehicle adoption, public transport usage, and CO₂ emissions reduction. It is based on official datasets from ISTAT, ENEA, and the Ministry for Ecological Transition.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Scope**: Mobility sustainability analysis across Italian regions  
- **Data Source**: Questionnaires + national statistics  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, variance)  
  - Graphs (bar charts, pie charts, correlation plots)  
  - Multivariate analysis (gender vs. transport mode)

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Majority of respondents use **private cars** (60%)
- Strong interest in **green mobility** (71%)
- Significant support for **bicycle use** and public transport
- Gender correlation: **females more likely** to use sustainable transport

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning & analysis  
- **Data Visualization** – Charts and graphs (bar, pie, correlation)  
- **Statistical Analysis** – Aggregates, variance, and cross-tabulations

## 🔍 Future Improvements

To enhance reproducibility and automation, a Python/SQL-based simulation is planned with:

- `pandas` for data analysis  
- `matplotlib` / `seaborn` for charts  
- `SQLite` or `PostgreSQL` for structured queries  
- Possible Jupyter Notebook version of the full study
